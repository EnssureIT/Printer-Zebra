Zebra label printer ZPL interpreter and rasterizator


Convert pbm image file to ZPL:

	pbm2ZPL.pl print.pnm > print.zpl

Convert ZPL back into pbm image:

	ZPL2pbm.pl dump.zpl > dump.pbm



This is my attempt to document various quirks using Zebra printers:


Windows printer driver doesn't seem to support ZPL when shared over CIFS.

There is option to check pass-through, but then you have to wrap ZPL in
start/end markers which cups printer driver doesn't do.

Easier solution is to install port as Generic/Text printer under Windows
and share printer using lpd which is available in Windows XP and newer.
